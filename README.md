This Project can be viewed here: [](https://astounding-axolotl-136906.netlify.app/)

If you want to use this code, make sure you're fetching to the following url for the free tier: [](www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php)
If you have your own api key (for fetching multiple meals at once), just slap it into Netlify under Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment > Environment Variables.
